    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gỏi cuốn (IPA: [ɣɔj˧˩ kuən˧˦]) or nem cuốn, salad roll, summer roll, fresh spring roll, spring roll, rice paper roll, is a Vietnamese dish traditionally consisting of pork, prawn, vegetables, bún (rice vermicelli), and other ingredients wrapped in Vietnamese bánh tráng (commonly known as rice paper or cold roll).Unlike other spring roll dishes which are believed to be originated from China, Vietnamese gỏi cuốn is the country's creation using rice paper.</p>
    <p>Gỏi cuốn are served fresh, unlike similar rolls that are served fried, like the Vietnamese chả giò. They are served at room temperature (or cooled) and are not deep-fried or cooked on the outside. These rolls are considered to be a very popular appetizer with customers in Vietnamese restaurants. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb pork belly</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 head green leaf lettuce</li>
        <li>1/2 lb shrimp</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch mint</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch chives</li>
        <li>1/2 pack dried spring roll wrapper</li>
        <li>1/3 pack dried rice noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add warm water to a plate and soak the rice paper sheet for about 5-10 seconds. Soak the rice paper just enough so that it is pliable and easy to handle, but remove the sheet before it gets too soft and sticky. Lay rice paper on a plate and begin to assemble your roll.</li>
        <li>Add lettuce towards the bottom of the rice paper. Leave 1 to 1½ inches of space on either side of the rice paper. Layer with mint and chives. Try to not add too many items because it will be harder to roll and might tear your rice paper.</li>
        <li>Add shrimp in the middle of the rice paper with the orange skin facing down. </li>
        <li>Layer the sliced pork on top of the shrimp.</li>
        <li>Add the noodles across the vegetables, spread evenly across.</li>
        <li>Fold the left and right sides towards the middle so that it's snug. Lay some chives lengthwise with one end poking out. Then fold the bottom up to cover the noodles. You want to keep the roll tight, so lightly squeeze it together as you roll. Continue to roll upwards to complete the spring roll.</li>
    </ol>
