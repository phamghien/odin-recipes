    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bánh xèo (Vietnamese: [ɓǎjŋ̟ sɛ̂w], lit. 'sizzling pancake') is a crispy, stuffed rice pancake popular in Vietnam. The name refers to the sound (from xèo – 'sizzling') a thin layer of rice batter makes when it is poured into the hot skillet. It is a savoury fried pancake made of rice flour, water, and turmeric powder. It can also be called a Vietnamese crêpe.</p>
    <p>Some common stuffings include pork, prawns, diced green onion, mung bean, and bean sprouts. Bánh xèo served with sides. Usually, some commonly added ingredients include leafy greens like lettuces or perilla leaves, other herbs as flavor enhancers like mint leaves and Thai basil, cucumbers, and pickled vegetables, usually carrots and radishes. Lastly, its dipping sauce is Nước chấm (sweet and sour garlic fish sauce). Elements of each side and sauce add to the fresh-tasting fried Bánh Xèo.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>255 g rice flower</li>
        <li>85 g all purpose flower</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp tumeric</li>
        <li>28 fl oz water</li>
        <li>14 fl oz coconut cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 green onion</li>
        <li>1 lb shrimp</li>
        <li>1.5 lb pork belly</li>
        <li>1/2 c dry mung bean</li>
        <li>1 head mustard greens</li>
        <li>1 bunch mint</li>
        <li>1 bunch cilantro</li>
        <li>1 bunch Vietnamese perilla</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On medium-high heat add 1-2 teaspoons of oil and some onions. </li>
        <li>Immediately add a few pieces of pork and shrimp. Sauté, lightly mixing until very lightly browned and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in some batter and quickly tilt & rotate the pan so the batter is evenly spread. Add more batter if it wasn't enough to cover the pan. There should only be a thin layer of batter that almost flakes off at the pan edges where it's thinner. If your batter doesn't do that and is too thick, add a few tbsp water to the batter and mix to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to medium. Add some mung beans, bean sprouts, and cover with a lid for about 3 minutes, or until bean sprouts are slightly cooked. The batter should also be slightly cooked and transparent around the edges. This step cooks the top side of the ingredients and batter while it steams since we won't be flipping the crepe.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid, lower heat to medium-low and wait for the crêpe to become crisp. This takes about 5-7 minutes. This step lets the ingredients fully cook through, including the batter. It also lets steam escape so the batter can crisp up. Brush on a little oil around the edges if you're not seeing or hearing enough batter to pan contact. Fold in half, transfer to a plate and serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
